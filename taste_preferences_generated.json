    "Baby's Face: Ensure baby's face is visible, well-lit, and in focus.",
    "Engagement: Prioritize photos showing the baby actively engaging with people or objects.",
    "Clear Expressions: Select photos with clear and expressive facial expressions (joy, curiosity, mischief).",
    "Parent-Baby Interaction: Favour shots depicting positive interactions between the baby and a parent, caregiver, or other child.",
    "Framing & Composition: Choose well-framed photos that focus on the baby and minimize distractions.",
    "Emotional Resonance: Select photos that evoke positive emotions like joy, love, wonder, or humour.",

    "interaction_quality": "Photos depicting positive interactions between the baby and others are highly preferred over solo shots. Shared gaze and physical touch are particularly valued.",
    "technical_threshold": "Photos should be reasonably well-lit and in focus. While professional quality is not expected, blurry, over/underexposed, or poorly composed shots should be rejected.",
    "emotional_content": "Photos should evoke positive emotions such as joy, love, wonder, curiosity, and humour. Genuine and authentic expressions are more important than perfectly posed shots.",

    "When evaluating photos, ask yourself, 'Does this photo capture the baby's personality and current stage of development?'",

    "Reject photos even if technically good if the baby looks unhappy (unless comically so).",
    "Focus on quality over quantity; it's better to have a few excellent photos than many mediocre ones."
