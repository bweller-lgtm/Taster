  "default_category": "Usable",
  "top_priorities": [
    "Product is the clear focal point, filling the frame appropriately",
    "Accurate color representation under neutral or white lighting",
    "Sharp focus on the product with clean background",
    "Professional composition that would look right on a product page",
    "Shows the product as a customer would want to see it"
  ],
  "positive_criteria": {
    "must_have": [
      "Product is in sharp focus",
      "Adequate lighting -- no harsh shadows obscuring product details",
      "Product is clearly identifiable and not cropped awkwardly"
    ],
    "highly_valued": [
      "Clean, uncluttered background (white, gradient, or contextual lifestyle)",
      "Multiple angles or detail shots showing key features",
      "Consistent style that would look cohesive in a product gallery",
      "Natural color balance -- product looks like it does in person"
    ],
    "bonus_points": [
      "Lifestyle context that helps the customer imagine owning the product",
      "Scale reference (hand, common object) for size context",
      "Catches the eye -- would stop someone mid-scroll"

  "negative_criteria": {
    "deal_breakers": [
      "Product out of focus or motion-blurred",
      "Color cast that misrepresents the product (yellow lighting, blue tint)",
      "Watermarks, logos, or text overlays from other sources"
    ],
    "negative_factors": [
      "Cluttered background competing with the product for attention",
      "Harsh shadows or blown-out highlights hiding product details",
      "Awkward angle that doesn't show the product well",
      "Dust, fingerprints, or imperfections visible on product",
      "Too much negative space -- product is small in a large frame"

  "specific_guidance": [
    "A clean shot on a white background with good lighting is almost always Hero material.",
    "Lifestyle shots can be Hero if the product is still the clear star -- not lost in the scene.",
    "Reject anything a customer would find misleading about the product's actual appearance.",
    "Consistency matters: if you're building a gallery, similar style across shots is more important than any single shot being perfect."
