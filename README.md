# Sommelier

**Teach AI your taste. Apply it to everything.**

Sort 1,000 family photos in 10 minutes for $1.30. Extract coding standards from your best code. Screen 500 resumes against criteria you didn't have to write by hand.

### You don't need to know your criteria.

Point Sommelier at examples you like and it figures out what they have in common, then applies your judgment at scale. The generated profile is both a human-readable style guide and an executable classifier -- your documented standards, synthesized from examples. This is what makes it different from a one-shot prompt: your taste compounds over time.

Works with photos, videos, documents, and source code. Supports **Gemini**, **OpenAI**, and **Anthropic** -- just set an API key and go.

---

## How It Works

1. **Classify** -- AI evaluates each file against your profile's criteria and sorts it into categories
2. **Learn** -- Feed the best results back in, and Sommelier synthesizes what makes them good
3. **Apply** -- The generated profile becomes a reusable classifier for future batches

Each cycle sharpens the profile. What starts as "sort my photos" becomes a rich, nuanced document that captures exactly how you think about quality -- then enforces it automatically.

## What People Use It For

### Family Photos

The original use case. Ships with a built-in profile that classifies photos into Share / Storage / Review / Ignore. Run it on a year of camera roll and get the 200 worth sharing for about a dollar.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example: AI-generated taste profile from a family photo library</strong></summary>

Nobody wrote this by hand -- it was synthesized from examples:

> **Philosophy:** Photos worth sharing capture genuine moments of connection and joy between baby and loved ones. They should highlight the baby's expressions, engagement with the world, and the loving interactions they share, all presented in a visually clear and appealing manner.
>
> **Top priorities (ranked):**
> 1. Baby's face is visible, well-lit, and in focus
> 2. Baby actively engaging with people or objects
> 3. Clear and expressive facial expressions (joy, curiosity, mischief)
> 4. Positive interactions between baby and parent/caregiver
> 5. Well-framed photos that focus on the baby and minimize distractions
> 6. Photos that evoke positive emotions -- joy, love, wonder, humor
> 7. Good lighting, sharpness, and minimal blur
>
> **Must-have:** Baby's face clearly visible and in focus. Baby engaged in the activity or with another person. Well-lit and sharp. Expressive and genuine emotion conveyed.
>
> **Highly valued:** Interactions between baby and parent (especially eye contact or physical touch). Baby displaying positive emotions. Photos that tell a story or capture a special moment.
>
> **Deal-breakers:** Baby's face not visible or obscured. Blurry or out of focus. Poor lighting. Baby displaying negative expression without context. Child too small in frame.
>
> **Burst guidance:** Prioritize the clearest expressions, best focus on the baby's face, and minimal distractions. Choose the photo that best captures the moment's essence.
>
> **Specific guidance:**
> - *"Does this photo capture the baby's personality and current stage of development?"*
> - *"If both parent and baby are in the photo, ensure both have engaged and positive expressions."*
> - *"Reject photos even if technically good if the baby looks unhappy (unless comically so)."*

That profile is both a human-readable style guide *and* an executable classifier. Every future photo is evaluated against those exact criteria.

</details>

### Grading at Scale

Grade 200 student submissions against *your* standards. Create a profile from a handful of A-grade and C-grade examples. Sommelier extracts what your grading decisions had in common and applies them to the full batch -- each result includes a brief explanation of why the submission landed where it did, grounded in the profile's criteria.

Classification uses confidence tiers:
- **High confidence** -- clearly strong or clearly weak submissions are graded automatically
- **Medium confidence** -- borderline work goes to a review pile for your attention
- **Low confidence** -- flagged for manual review rather than guessing

You set the thresholds per category. A grading profile might use `Strong: 0.70, Developing: 0.40` -- anything above 70% confidence goes to Strong, 40-70% to Developing, below 40% to Needs Work. The instructor focuses on the edge cases that require higher judgment, not the obvious calls.

### Code Standards

Point Sommelier at your `src/` directory with a code quality profile. It classifies every file into tiers (Exemplary / Solid / Needs Work). Feed the Exemplary bucket back into profile generation and Sommelier synthesizes *your* standards -- error handling patterns, naming conventions, architectural choices you actually follow. That profile becomes both a style guide and an automated reviewer for future code.

### Any Collection

Research papers, product photos, legal documents, design assets. Anything where you "know it when you see it" but can't write the rules upfront. Sommelier closes the gap between your tacit taste and explicit, repeatable judgment.

---

## Taste Profiles

Profiles define *what* you're classifying, *how* you want it categorized, and *what criteria* to use.

### Example Profile

```json
{
  "name": "linkedin-profiles",
  "description": "Sort LinkedIn profile PDFs by hire potential",
  "media_types": ["document"],
  "categories": [
    {"name": "Strong", "description": "Excellent candidates to interview"},
    {"name": "Maybe", "description": "Worth a second look"},
    {"name": "Pass", "description": "Not a match for this role"}
  ],
  "top_priorities": [
    "Relevant experience in the target domain",
    "Track record of increasing responsibility",
    "Technical skills alignment"
  ],
  "positive_criteria": {
    "must_have": ["Relevant industry experience", "Clear career progression"],
    "highly_valued": ["Leadership experience", "Quantified achievements"]
  },
  "negative_criteria": {
    "deal_breakers": ["No relevant experience", "Frequent job hopping without growth"]
  },
  "philosophy": "Focus on demonstrated impact and growth potential over credentials.",
  "thresholds": {"Strong": 0.70, "Maybe": 0.40}
}
```

Profiles are stored as JSON in the `profiles/` directory.

### Ways to Create a Profile

| Method | Input | Time | Fidelity |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| Quick Profile | Plain English description | ~10s | Low |
| Generate from Examples | Good/bad example folders | ~2 min | Medium |
| **Pairwise Training** | 15-50+ side-by-side comparisons | 15-30 min | **High** |

- **Quick profile:** Ask Claude *"Create a profile for sorting research papers into Keep, Skim, and Skip"* and it generates one from your description.
- **From examples:** Point `sommelier_generate_profile` at a folder of good examples and a folder of bad examples. Sommelier analyzes both and synthesizes criteria.
- **Pairwise training:** Start a training session on a photo folder. Sommelier presents side-by-side comparisons and burst galleries. After 15-50+ choices, it synthesizes a high-fidelity profile from your decisions. Run entirely through MCP tools in Claude Desktop.
- **By hand:** Write a JSON file directly in `profiles/`.

### Keeping a Profile Sharp

After creating a profile, **corrective refinement** is how you keep it accurate. Classify a folder, correct the results you disagree with, then call `sommelier_refine_profile`. Sommelier analyzes the gap between its predictions and your corrections and adjusts criteria, thresholds, and priorities to match your actual preferences. Repeat each batch to continuously sharpen the profile -- this produces the highest fidelity over time.

### Training and Feedback

The primary training workflow runs through MCP tools in Claude Desktop:

1. **Pairwise training** -- `sommelier_start_training` scans a folder, detects bursts, and begins a session. Use `sommelier_get_comparison` and `sommelier_submit_comparison` to work through side-by-side choices. For burst groups, `sommelier_submit_gallery` lets you pick keepers. When done, `sommelier_synthesize_profile` generates a profile from your decisions.

2. **Corrective refinement** -- After classifying a folder, correct any misclassified files and call `sommelier_refine_profile` with the corrections. The AI analyzes what the profile got wrong and adjusts criteria, thresholds, and priorities to match your actual preferences.

3. **Simple feedback** -- Submit individual corrections via `sommelier_submit_feedback` for lightweight feedback without full refinement.

> **Legacy scripts:** `taste_trainer_pairwise_v4.py` (Gradio UI) and `learn_from_reviews.py` still exist in the repo for standalone use.

## Getting Started

Sommelier runs as an MCP server inside Claude Desktop, or as a standalone CLI / REST API.

### Claude Desktop (Recommended)

Connect Sommelier to Claude Desktop and use it conversationally. No command-line needed after setup.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, at least one AI provider API key.

**Step 1.** Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bweller-lgtm/Sommelier.git
cd Sommelier
py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2.** Create a `.env` file in the project root with at least one key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here      # Recommended (cheapest, native video/PDF)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here      # GPT-4o / GPT-4.1
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here   # Claude
```

**Step 3.** Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sommelier": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/Sommelier",
        "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8",
        "PYTHONUTF8": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 4.** Restart Claude Desktop. Ask it: *"Check my Sommelier status"* to verify everything is connected.

From there, just talk to it:
- *"Sort the photos in my Camera Roll folder"*
- *"Create a profile for screening resumes"*
- *"Generate a taste profile from my best code examples in src/"*

## AI Providers

Sommelier supports three AI providers. Install only the SDK(s) you need.

| Feature | Gemini | OpenAI (GPT-4o/4.1) | Anthropic (Claude) |
|---------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Images | Native | Base64 | Base64 |
| Videos | Native upload | Frame extraction | Frame extraction |
| PDFs | Native upload | Page-to-image | Native |
| Relative cost | Cheapest | Mid | Most expensive |
| Env var | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

Gemini is the recommended default -- cheapest and has native video/PDF support. The system auto-detects which key is available (gemini > openai > anthropic), or you can force a provider with `--provider` or in `config.yaml`.

---

## Cost Estimates

Gemini 3 Flash pricing (cheapest provider):

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Photo | ~$0.0013 |
| Burst photo | ~$0.00043 (shared prompt) |
| Video | ~$0.011 per minute |
| Document | ~$0.002-0.01 (varies by size) |

**Example:** 1,000 photos = ~$1.30 (first run), ~$0 (cached re-run).

OpenAI and Anthropic cost more per call. See provider pricing pages for current rates.

---

## Configuration

All settings are in `config.yaml`. Key sections:

```yaml

## Output Structure

```
MyFolder_sorted/
├── Share/                       # Share-worthy photos/videos
├── Storage/                     # Keep but don't share
├── Review/                      # Needs manual review
├── Ignore/                      # Not relevant
├── ImprovementCandidates/       # Gray zone photos (if enabled)
│   └── improvement_candidates.csv
├── Improved/                    # AI-enhanced photos
└── Reports/                     # Classification logs (CSV)
```

For custom profiles, output folders match the profile's category names (e.g., `Strong/`, `Maybe/`, `Pass/`).

---

## Photo Improvement (Gray Zone)

Detects meaningful family moments with technical issues (blur, noise, bad exposure) and uses Gemini AI to enhance them.

1. **During classification** -- Gray zone photos are copied to `ImprovementCandidates/`
2. **Review** -- Approve candidates via Gradio UI or CSV editing
3. **Improve** -- `py -3.12 improve_photos.py "path/to/sorted_folder"`

Cost: ~$0.134 per image (Gemini 3 Pro) or ~$0.039 (Flash). Originals are always preserved.

---

## Error Handling

Automatic retry with exponential backoff for API failures.

| Error Type | Retriable | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `api_error` | Yes | General API failures |
| `timeout` | Yes | Request timeout |
| `rate_limit` | Yes | API rate limiting |
| `invalid_response` | Yes | Malformed API response |
| `safety_blocked` | No | Content blocked by safety filters |
| `load_error` | No | Failed to load file |

Reprocess failures:
```bash
py -3.12 clear_failed_for_retry.py "path/to/sorted" --dry-run  # Preview
py -3.12 clear_failed_for_retry.py "path/to/sorted"            # Clear and re-run
```

## Troubleshooting

**"No AI provider configured"** -- Create `.env` with at least one API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

**"No module named 'src'"** -- Run from the project root directory.

**Low share rate (<20%)** -- Lower `classification.share_threshold` in `config.yaml` (e.g., 0.50).

**Document extraction issues** -- Install the relevant parser: `py -3.12 -m pip install pypdf python-docx openpyxl python-pptx beautifulsoup4`.
