<p align="center"><strong>Teach AI your taste. Apply it to everything.</strong></p>

You know quality when you see it -- but writing down *why* is the hard part. Taster figures it out for you. Show it examples you like and it reverse-engineers your standards into a reusable profile: a human-readable style guide that doubles as an executable classifier.

Sort 1,000 family photos in 10 minutes for $1.30. Extract coding standards from your best files. Grade 200 essays against criteria you never had to write by hand.

## Demo

**280 photos + videos classified in 12 minutes for $0.30** (10 parallel workers, Gemini Flash).

</p>

Every file gets a score, a plain-English reason, and per-dimension diagnostic scores -- all grounded in the taste profile's criteria:

</p>

Burst photos taken seconds apart are compared head-to-head -- AI picks the best and explains why:

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bweller-lgtm/Taster/master/assets/demo_burst.png" alt="Burst intelligence: AI picks the best from a series" width="780">
</p>

Dimension scores show *why* each file scored the way it did -- which priorities drove the decision:

```
8_hero_share.jpg [Share] score=5
  parent_child_interaction_quality:        4
  baby_expression_mischief_joy_engagement: 5
  parent_expressions_should_be_engaged:    4
  baby_face_clearly_visible:               5
  genuine_emotional_moments:               5

4_technical_pass_share.jpg [Storage] score=2
  parent_child_interaction_quality:        1  ← no parent in frame
  baby_expression_mischief_joy_engagement: 2
  parent_expressions_should_be_engaged:    1  ← no parent in frame
  baby_face_clearly_visible:               5
  genuine_emotional_moments:               2
```

Dimensions are auto-derived from the profile's `top_priorities`. When a photo scores high on face visibility but low on interaction and emotion, you know *exactly* what to adjust.

Full score distribution and category breakdown:

## How It Works

1. **Classify** -- AI evaluates each file against your profile's criteria, sorts it into categories, and returns per-dimension diagnostic scores
2. **Learn** -- Feed results back in with corrections, and Taster uses dimension scores to pinpoint what needs adjusting
3. **Apply** -- The refined profile becomes a sharper classifier for future batches

Each cycle sharpens the profile. What starts as "sort my photos" becomes a rich, nuanced document that captures exactly how you think about quality -- then enforces it automatically.

## What People Use It For

### Family Photos

The original use case. Ships with a built-in profile that classifies photos into Share / Storage / Review / Ignore. Run it on a year of camera roll and get the 200 worth sharing for about a dollar.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example: AI-generated taste profile from a family photo library</strong></summary>

Nobody wrote this by hand -- it was synthesized from examples:

> **Philosophy:** Photos worth sharing capture genuine moments of connection and joy between baby and loved ones. They should highlight the baby's expressions, engagement with the world, and the loving interactions they share, all presented in a visually clear and appealing manner.
>
> **Top priorities (ranked):**
> 1. Baby's face is visible, well-lit, and in focus
> 2. Baby actively engaging with people or objects
> 3. Clear and expressive facial expressions (joy, curiosity, mischief)
> 4. Positive interactions between baby and parent/caregiver
> 5. Well-framed photos that focus on the baby and minimize distractions
> 6. Photos that evoke positive emotions -- joy, love, wonder, humor
> 7. Good lighting, sharpness, and minimal blur
>
> **Must-have:** Baby's face clearly visible and in focus. Baby engaged in the activity or with another person. Well-lit and sharp. Expressive and genuine emotion conveyed.
>
> **Highly valued:** Interactions between baby and parent (especially eye contact or physical touch). Baby displaying positive emotions. Photos that tell a story or capture a special moment.
>
> **Deal-breakers:** Baby's face not visible or obscured. Blurry or out of focus. Poor lighting. Baby displaying negative expression without context. Child too small in frame.
>
> **Burst guidance:** Prioritize the clearest expressions, best focus on the baby's face, and minimal distractions. Choose the photo that best captures the moment's essence.
>
> **Specific guidance:**
> - *"Does this photo capture the baby's personality and current stage of development?"*
> - *"If both parent and baby are in the photo, ensure both have engaged and positive expressions."*
> - *"Reject photos even if technically good if the baby looks unhappy (unless comically so)."*

That profile is both a human-readable style guide *and* an executable classifier. Every future photo is evaluated against those exact criteria.

</details>

### Grading at Scale

Grade 200 student submissions against *your* standards. Create a profile from a handful of A-grade and C-grade examples. Taster extracts what your grading decisions had in common and applies them to the full batch -- each result includes a brief explanation of why the submission landed where it did, grounded in the profile's criteria.

### Code Standards

Start with a code quality profile -- generate one from a quick description or write your own. Taster classifies every file into tiers (Exemplary / Solid / Needs Work) with explanations. Review the results, correct what you disagree with, and refine the profile. Each cycle sharpens it until the profile captures the standards you actually follow -- error handling patterns, naming conventions, architectural choices. That profile becomes both a style guide and an automated reviewer for future code.

### Any Collection

Research papers, product photos, legal documents, design assets. Anything where you "know it when you see it" but can't write the rules upfront. Taster closes the gap between your tacit taste and explicit, repeatable judgment.

---

## Taste Profiles

Profiles define *what* you're classifying, *how* you want it categorized, and *what criteria* to use.

### Example Profile

```json
{
  "name": "student-essays",
  "categories": [
    {"name": "Strong", "description": "Excellent work, minimal feedback needed"},
    {"name": "Developing", "description": "Shows promise, needs specific feedback"},
    {"name": "Needs Work", "description": "Significant gaps to address"}
  ],
  "top_priorities": ["Clear thesis supported by evidence", "Logical structure", "Engagement with sources"],
  "philosophy": "Reward critical thinking and clear communication over polish.",
  "thresholds": {"Strong": 0.70, "Developing": 0.40}
}
```

Profiles are stored as JSON in `profiles/`. Taster ships with starter profiles for common use cases -- family photos, code review, student essays, and product photography. See the full schema in `profiles/default-photos.json`.

### Ways to Create a Profile

| Method | Input | Time | Best for |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| Quick Profile | Plain English description | ~10s | Getting started fast |
| Generate from Examples | Good/bad example folders | ~2 min | When you have sorted examples |
| **Pairwise Training** | 15-50+ side-by-side comparisons | 15-30 min | **Highest accuracy** |

- **Quick profile:** Ask Claude *"Create a profile for sorting research papers into Keep, Skim, and Skip"* and it generates one from your description. Great for a first pass.
- **From examples:** Point `taster_generate_profile` at a folder of good examples and a folder of bad examples. Taster analyzes both and synthesizes criteria.
- **Pairwise training:** Launch the Gradio trainer (`taster train <folder>`) for the highest-fidelity option. Compare photos side-by-side, pick keepers from burst galleries, and synthesize a profile that captures exactly how you think about quality.
- **By hand:** Write a JSON file directly in `profiles/`.

### Training and Refinement

Profiles improve over time:

1. **Pairwise training** -- Run `taster train <folder>` to launch a Gradio UI. Compare photos side-by-side, pick keepers from burst galleries, and synthesize a profile when you have enough labels (15+).

2. **Corrective refinement** -- After classifying a folder, correct the results you disagree with and call `taster_refine_profile` in Claude Desktop. Taster analyzes the gap between its predictions and your corrections -- including per-dimension scores that reveal *which* criteria are miscalibrated -- and adjusts priorities, thresholds, and guidance. Repeat each batch to continuously sharpen the profile.

3. **Simple feedback** -- Submit individual corrections via `taster_submit_feedback` for lightweight feedback without full refinement.

---

## Getting Started

Taster runs as an MCP server inside Claude Desktop, or as a standalone CLI / REST API.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, at least one AI provider API key.

### Install

```bash
pip install taster[gemini]        # Gemini (recommended -- cheapest)
# or: pip install taster[openai]  # OpenAI
# or: pip install taster[all]     # Everything
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Install from source</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bweller-lgtm/Sommelier.git
cd Sommelier
pip install -e ".[gemini]"
```

</details>

### First-run setup

```bash
taster init
```

Creates your config directory, prompts for API keys, and optionally wires up Claude Desktop. Config files are stored in a platform-appropriate location:
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\taster\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/taster/`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/taster/` (default `~/.config/taster/`)

### Claude Desktop (Recommended)

Connect Taster to Claude Desktop and use it conversationally. No command-line needed after setup. Taster's MCP server is compatible with any MCP host -- the examples below show Claude Desktop, but it works with any app that supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

If `taster init` configured Claude Desktop for you, just restart Claude Desktop. Otherwise, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taster": {
      "command": "taster",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8",
        "PYTHONUTF8": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop config locations</strong></summary>

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Running from a cloned repo (alternative)</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taster": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/Sommelier",
        "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8",
        "PYTHONUTF8": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Restart Claude Desktop. Ask it: *"Check my Taster status"* to verify everything is connected. Then just talk to it:
- *"Sort the photos in my Camera Roll folder"*
- *"Create a profile for grading student essays"*
- *"Generate a taste profile from my best code examples in src/"*
- *"Refine my photo profile -- I disagreed with some of the results"*

## AI Providers

Taster supports three AI providers. Install only the SDK(s) you need.

| Feature | Gemini | OpenAI (GPT-4o/4.1) | Anthropic (Claude) |
|---------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Images | Native | Base64 | Base64 |
| Videos | Native upload | Frame extraction | Frame extraction |
| Audio | Native upload | Text fallback | Text fallback |
| PDFs | Native upload | Page-to-image | Native |
| Relative cost | Cheapest | Mid | Most expensive |
| Env var | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

Gemini is the recommended default -- cheapest and has native video/PDF support. The system auto-detects which key is available (gemini > openai > anthropic), or you can force a provider with `--provider` or in `config.yaml`.
