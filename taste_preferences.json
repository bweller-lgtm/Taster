      "Can't see baby's face clearly",

      "Subjects looking in different directions (unless intentional)",

  "contextual_notes": {
    "parent_expressions": "Parent expressions matter as much as baby's. A photo with perfect baby but vacant parent is not share-worthy.",
    "interaction_over_solo": "Photos showing interaction between parent and child are preferred over solo baby shots, unless baby is doing something particularly special.",
    "technical_threshold": "Technical quality is important but not sufficient - a technically perfect photo of an ordinary moment is still Storage.",
    "burst_philosophy": "In burst mode, only keep the absolute best 1-2 photos. Don't share from every burst."
  },

  "share_philosophy": "I want photos that capture genuine moments of connection, emotion, and personality - especially between parent and child. Technical quality matters, but the emotional content and interaction quality matter more."
